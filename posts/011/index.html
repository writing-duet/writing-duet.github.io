            <p>This morning, the radio reminded me that today is the beginning of Summer. &quot;Hard to believe with the rains we've known lately, and yet...&quot; They said. Here in Montreal, it seems more believable: we've been going through a heatwave for a few days. It's the kind of weather that could make me desperate for an intensity control button. Nine years ago, days for days, J. and I were also caught in terrible temperatures: we had just arrived in Las Vegas after spending two days at the Grand Canyon. It was at least 45°C during the day and, while we spent the night on The Strip, the temperatures didn't drop below 38°C. I had bought a nice big water bottle at the Grand Canyon visitor center because I didn't have any. This week, this very bottle broke. </p>
