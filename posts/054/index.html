            <p>Game Master is one of the roles of TTRPGs that I have always held in awe. When I was in college, I used to meet with a group weekly to play Mage, Exalted, Werewolf, and Deadlands. The game master was phenomenal: he knew the ins and outs of all the lore and the stories told were always incredibly rich with detail. Since I’ve moved away, I had looked for another group to join for the same games, but those are now considered “retro.”  Now, to play the TTRPGs I want to, I have to create my own group, be my own GM, and find world systems that I can imagine spending hours in, mastering the mechanics and lore. I missed the relaunch of the “retro” Mage kickstarter, but maybe I can make up for it with Brandon Sanderson’s new TTRPG for The Way of Kings.</p>
