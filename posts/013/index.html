            <p>M. says that bugs are useful, that when technology doesn't work, at least not the way we want or expect, it forces us to stop and think about our environment and tools. He also debunks a myth I was particularly attached to: Grace Hopper is often said to be the one who coined the &quot;bug&quot; expression, after having found a cockroach or a bedbug in a computer unit. In my lab in France, we had meeting rooms called after renowned scientists and Grace Hopper was one of them. I really liked the idea that someone whose name was so close to that of a bug (grasshopper) had coined the usage of the word &quot;bug&quot; in her discipline. But it's inaccurate, the expression already existed then, and she simply  made it to posterity thanks to a well calculated pun! </p>
