            <p>We picked sour cherries from the trees in M's garden. Since they are too sour to be eaten fresh, I plan on turning them into jam -once I find enough jars. I don't really remember when was the first time I cooked jam, but I know my mother taught me how to sterilize the jars not that many years ago. For the longest time, from my perspective, there were two jam specialists in my family: my aunt and my grand mother. Even today, I sometimes text my aunt to get her jam recipes. From my grand mother, I have kept one jar of bitter orange marmalade that I can't resolve to through away, even though I don't think I'll ever eat it. It has followed me through several moves around Paris already: maybe one day it'll make its way into our pantry in Canada.</p>
