            <p>I am always impressed with my colleagues who are able to answer their emails within a week. On my part, I can quickly build an embarassing backlog of emails, some of which have been waiting for an answer for a few months. I have stopped beating myself about it, it would be too much to worry about and if I choose to keep afloat with responding to these emails, it would be by sacrificing other things I want or need to do. I think my strategy now has become to respond to older messages whenever I have time to, and otherwise to consider that if it is important or urgent, I'll receive a follow up message. Then it's no longer my responsibility to keep up with my emails, but my contact's to insist if they thought I didn't pay enough attention.</p>
