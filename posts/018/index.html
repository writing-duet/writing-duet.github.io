            <p>A couple days ago a friend told me that he used to live near a school where he played sports as a kid. When he said the name, I instantly lit up – I played sports there too! In fact, that is the exact place where I learned how to play softball before moving on to play competitive nationally. I remember the different softball fields, the massive playground nearby, the snack bar that the parents had to take turns manning. My friend laughed a little when I started reminiscing – back when he was there it was just a series of fields where community-sponsored youth teams would meet, with not much else around. He’s not that much older than me, but still the places we both know are almost worlds apart. It’s crazy how much an area can change in just a little bit of time.</p>
