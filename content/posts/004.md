A good playlist makes all the difference when I am trying to get back into running. A song too slow, and my pace will decline, or I’ll lose the mental capacity for slogging one foot after another, mile after mile. A song too fast will burn me out and I’ll be left gasping for breath on the side of the road. But a series of good songs that keep me properly paced, energize you and maintain the right headspace? The workout won’t just be easier: it will fly by. There’s a saying that having fun helps arduous tasks feel less lengthy - you become distracted from constantly monitoring the clock, thus time seems to pass more quickly. For me it is effective for a couple hours’ workout. But those ultra-marathon runners must have incredible playlists.
