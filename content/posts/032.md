Home prices in Montreal are at an all-time high. Last month, the average single-family detached home sold for $614,972, a 5.4% increase over the prior year, and 52% higher than five years ago. In Toronto, the average price was $1,480,399, and in Vancouver: $2,343,282. While the price of lodgings has skyrocketed in Montreal since the pandemic, at least it is still feasible to imagine owning a home one day. I look forward to having our own space to add a wood working shop, a gaming room, a kidâ€™s room or two with space enough for them to run around. I want a pantry where we can store all our homemade confitures and tomatoes and pickles grown from our own garden. Maybe to have all this we would have to live in the countryside. Would it be that bad?
