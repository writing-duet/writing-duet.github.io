It’s bee season and I don’t like bugs. But I do like to bee prepared if one gets close. Sitting on the deck, cooling off from a heatwave can be a relaxing activity – as long as bees aren’t actively trying to land on you. Which ones are the most dangerous? Well, that’s the Africanized honeybee. But here in Canada where there’s only 800/20,000 species, the most common ones to worry about are yellow-jackets. They will sting you just got the heck of it. These vicious little dudes can be identified by their small, narrow-waisted two-part body with yellow/black stripes on the bottom and mostly black on the top half. What else to look out for? Paper-wasps and hornets. Honey bees are actually the chill-est of the bunch, something we can bee positive about.
