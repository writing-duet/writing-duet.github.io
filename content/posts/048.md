Week after week flies by and there are a hundred new things I’ve wanted to do but haven’t committed the time to actually doing. I would love to write a book, and I have a few ideas for a storyline. I would be happy to learn another language other than French, but I don’t start because I am worried it will mess up my already precarious knowledge of conversational French, just how French did to my knowledge of Spanish. I would like to plan out the interior design for our next apartment, but I don’t do this either. Not even the hummus recipe I am so looking forward to eating: I fail to do these side projects when now is the moment when I have time for them. Time keeps marching forward and the opportunities I should take advantage of fly right on by.
