Thereâ€™s an episode of The Twilight Zone where a man finds a miniature model of a city in his attic. As he fiddles with it, he realizes that what happens to the model is mimicked in the town itself, from weather changes to structures changing. He has complete control over the town. While he could have gone Bruce Almighty-esque and done whatever he pleased to further his own agenda, instead, he chooses to dig through the letter box of suggestions to improve the city and systematically fixes all the deteriorated, broken-down components, even potholes bothering some elderly residents.  It is an interesting take on the power of one individual as an agent of change and the good that can be done for the lives of many. Each in our own way, we can all make a difference.
