A commitment is an agreement for the future, a pledge to do something we say we'll do. Like this duet project. Or like signing a lease. Interestingly, in Git, a commit is only the capture of the state of a project. A `git commit` is not a commitment for the future but an agreement on the past. And this agreement is not even imutable: a simple `git commit --amend` and you can change the whole log. In Git, there is still time to go back in time, no need to think twice about a commit message. Can there be regrets in Git? Sometimes, I wish life could work like that: didn't think this through long enough? Let me just go back to the previous state and make some changes! But then, we wouldn't want to risk getting caught in a real-life merge conflict...
