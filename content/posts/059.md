Two years ago, one month ago... time flies and it's often tempting to pretend it doesn't. I feel stupid every time I commit to be better organized, and it eventually falls through. I admire and at the same time am frightened by organized minds: M seems to have a vision, a model already set when he starts a project; J thinks things through; A and R talk and it's so clear, paced and organized that you would think they're reading notes. They already know where their sentence go. I am carried by instinct and chaos. I have a general idea of where I'm headed but I can take detour, I can hop over obstacles and miss some of the course, my destination might remain the same, or it might change, but the journey, save for its chaotic nature, is not predictable.
