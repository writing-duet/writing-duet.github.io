The floor, in this house that isn't ours, shakes when a bus drives down the street. When I sit at M.'s desk, I can feel the deep vibrations from the floor under my chair. They travel up my legs and through my elbows. It makes me feel unstable, on edge, as if the house is about to take off and move into orbit. It makes me want to get up and move. I should just go in the middle of the room and shake it off dancing on the rythm of the music playing in my ears. 
I think this repeated agitation echoes my impatience to settle down in our own home: the provisionality of our situation makes our surrounding unstable, ready to take off or dissipate. I hold on to M.'s desk, and I wonder if he works better at night, when the bus is not running.
