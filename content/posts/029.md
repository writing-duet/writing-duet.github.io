 This enterprise of writing a text everyday has us bound to a rhythm we shouldn't break. We agreed that there should be no rupture in the pace of posting 750 characters each day. However, sometimes the inspiration is missing. It's my turn today but, even if the day was filled with various events, somehow nothing, no thought seems worth dedicating this many characters? It's exasperating. What link can I possibly build between Meloni and the Reese's Blizzard cup I ate earlier? Is it okay to talk about Trump one day and to move on to describing pleasing memories the next? Can I talk about the mundanity of an eventless subway ride in Montreal if I don't have anything sailant to say about it? 50 characters left, it's so many and so few at once...
