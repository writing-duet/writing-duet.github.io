"Sonder" was "coined by John Koenig in his project 'The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows'," ChatGPT tells me. I remembered hearing about it on Instagram last year. I had forgotten the term, so I tried to find it on Google and eventually turned to ChatGPT: I needed feedback to rephrase my request, it gave me the answer right away. 'Sonder' describes the realization that random passersby are the main character of their own lifestory, and that, just as they are insignificant extras in our life, we do not represent anything but a detail in their field of vision. Often, and for so long I can't remember when I started, when I walk in the street, I try to trick my brain into peeking at the abyss of this realization. It fills me with an enthusiastic vertigo.
