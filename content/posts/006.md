Rome, New York. Dunkirk, New York. Amsterdam, New York. Paris, Texas. Moscow, Idaho. Madrid, New Mexico. Yes, these places really exist. For the longest time I just accepted the shade people would throw at Americans for not having enough imagination to create names for our own cities. That we had to copy from older, more established civilizations. What I didn’t realize until much later is the opposite is true. When these cities were established, they were likely colonies held by a foreign power. These foreign colonists settled and used names from their homeland as the foundation for their new life abroad. However, now that the land is controlled by the USA, its easy to forget that the duplicate wasn’t just caused by “those lazy Americans.”
