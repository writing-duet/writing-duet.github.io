Every year, my school organized a cross-country race. We would practice endurance running, doing endless laps around the small soccer field. The circuit was the same every year: through the farm court behind the municipal sports hall (they had a dachshund who would chase after you), to the right down the gravel path, straight alongside the garlic and wheat fields, then up the grass field -freshly mowed for the occasion, under the walnut tree, over the small bridge over the little stream, and straight up down my classmates' backyards to finish at the end of that old honor field. There were landmarks to keep on track: for example, I could spend hundreds of characters recalling the particular color of the piece of fabric hanging from the walnut tree.
