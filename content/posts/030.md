Do we have control over our choices or are they made by factors outside of our control? I find the question interesting because if we focus on the scientific aspect, it necessitates thinking about how we each define our locus of control. Personally, I have a locus of control that is potentially too large – I think that I am in control of things I am actually not influencing. Therefore, I agree more with the free will side: so what if I have muscle memory or a history of acting and responding a certain way? If I am aware of it, I can decide to do otherwise. Take baking for example: I’ve always made only one loaf of banana bread, following the recipe exactly. Today, I made my first double batch, and I used different sugar, frozen bananas, and the wrong shaped pans.
