I read an article the other day where a journalist wondered whether it was a good idea to have kids participate in actions to clean beaches. The argument against was that this solution to plastic pollution of beaches and water in general is part of a bigger orchestration from bigger industries to make cleaning an individual problem as opposed to a systemic issue greatly encouraged by big producing firms. The individual tossing their wrapping paper outside of the trash can is thus the tree who hides a forest of massive polluters. As in many other domains, I despair that the current society which results in the explosion of communities into smaller and smaller units of individual consumers makes it so difficult to stand together to make changes happen.
