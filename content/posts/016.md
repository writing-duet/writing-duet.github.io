One thing people don’t tell you about growing older is how difficult it is to decide what to eat – every day, three times a day. Meal prepping is okay, but am I getting enough variety of vitamins and veggies? Do I really want to eat that protein burrito every day for the next two months? Meal planning seems like a better option but gets KO ’ed when A. or I have specific cravings or stay downtown late (yes, let’s go to Mr Beef for a burger, which happens to also be the only nearby place open at this hour). That leaves delivered meal kits, which are a good idea and have a decent level of spontaneity, but are also prohibitively expensive. To sum it up: it should be healthy, cheap, easy to prepare, and not something we have eaten recently. So, do you have any ideas for dinner?
