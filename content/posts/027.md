A flat disk balancing on a needle. It seems like a fitted metaphor for the nightmare that has taken place over the past weeks. Some 65 millions of people supposedly under an agreement that this balance is worth more than anything else. And yet, so many, blind, idiots and full of hatred, have decided to run as far as they can. "To the edge! Beyond the edge! We've never tried that void underneath, surely it can't do any harm!" And thousands, millions of them, now rushing to the right, falling off the edge. And we stand there, on the other side, horrified, unable to do anything but call them back, trying to save the balance. It's too late, they're too far, they won't hear. Tonight the disk is still precariously balancing. But what about tomorrow?
