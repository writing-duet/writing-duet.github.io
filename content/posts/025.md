Riding a bike in the Summer, in the middle of the afternoon or at 2AM, wherever I am, fills me with a strange feeling halfway between nostalgia and euphoria. I feel immensely free on a bike. I can move faster, go further. It expands my horizon and at the same time densifies my apprehension of the space around me. I remember one of the first times I rode a bike in Paris: I connected places I had never been aware were so close, because I was used to reaching them with the subway. I remember very vividly how I felt (and the beauty of the landscape) when, after the months of confinement, I was able to ride a bike again in the countryside. Some people dream of flying endlessly in the sky, I think I could dream of riding a bike all over Earth.
