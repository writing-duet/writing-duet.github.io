Before moving to France I had to go through everything I owned and decide what I could manage to bring with me. I did this twice: once before leaving Michigan and again before shipping my stuff to France. If I were to guess, I donated/sold about 70% of what I owned: my car,  bike, camping equipment, half my books, an Instapot, a desktop computer, etc. I even dismantled three boxes worth of competitive sports trophies I had won so I could at least keep the nameplates. Despite all the effort, I still have a whole trunk full of keepsakes: youth aptitude tests, yearbooks, sports competition memorabilia, etc. While they may have zero intrinsic value, they help me remember parts of my life that are otherwise blacked out. Some things are easily forgotten.
