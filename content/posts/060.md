Predictable things can be boring, except when it is something you have planned ahead. Sometimes a change in the plan is just rude. For example, today we got our first online order from a store that was impossibly annoying to set up. In fact, it was supposed to be delivered yesterday but they blew it off. Today, I check my email for updates every 30 minutes or so until I see the familiar “sometime before the end of the day” status arrive. Fantastic. Well, good thing I left the building earlier this afternoon because without giving me any update they left the packages by the entrance, not secured behind a locked door. A place where anyone walking by can just grab them and take off. Like I said, sometimes it is just plain rude.
