Habits come and go, but habit trackers take up space forever. So do the tens of thousands of photos currently sitting on my phone, computers, hard drives, and cloud storage. Will I ever do something with them? Yes, probably. But do I have to sort and make severe cuts in what I actually keep? Absolutely. But it is not only a problem with how many: over the years the file size also get increasingly larger. Same with to do lists, exercise logs, etc. While it can be interesting to know what we do day-to-day, we donâ€™t need an app that takes up way more space. In fact, using an app makes it less likely that we would take a look back on the files we are saving. What we attempt to preserve, in reality, becomes hidden and eventually lost.
