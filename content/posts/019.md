There are two soccer fields in my hometown. We referred to one as the "small field" and I've  always heard my dad call the other one the "honor field." It is used for official competitions. I "played" rugby once on that honor field when my primary school teacher organized an inter-class, girls and boys, rugby competition. Aside from this notable exception, soccer and rugby were for boys so I didn't have reasons to go on the honor field. I'm convinced that it was inaccessible during a long period of time, probably when they remodeled the landscape around it. But my memory is fleeting, I can barely picture the field during the construction (I was 8 or 9), and even if I know the field looked different  after, I can no longer remember what changed.
