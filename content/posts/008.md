Sometimes we need to set boundaries, sometimes we need to vent, and sometimes we just need to be lazy. I’ve been told that the important thing is to listen and understand what our body is telling us. However, this is not an ideal world and pressure comes from all sides, including inside. What makes it okay to give oneself a break and not be perfect 100% of the time? Honestly, I don’t know the answer to that. Maybe it is just simply that no one is perfect. What I do know is that hearing someone say, “yes, I agree, you deserve to…” is like a breath of fresh air. Wait, someone else agrees and I don’t have to fight tooth and nail for this little bit of grace? Where’s the trick, what’s the catch? Wait, you just…agree?
