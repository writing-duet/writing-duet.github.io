Today is Prime Day, and while it might not be a hallmark of capitalism, it is still a massive event for amazon customers. The gist: two days each year amazon deeply discounts a bunch of products, giving their own brands the best deals and ads. But there is a major issue many of these big-box retailers are exploiting to scam customers – they artificially inflate the prices in the “previous price” section so when the discount is calculated, it seems like a better deal and pressures the customers into making a purchase. Grocery stores have been doing something similar with meat products: marking an incorrect weight on the packaging/label which the customer then pays for without knowing they are paying double. I don’t understand how these scams can be so prevalent.
