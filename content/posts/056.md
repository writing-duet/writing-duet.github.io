Blatantly disregarding my exhaustion and need for sleep, my second day at S. and M.’s house finds me waking up at 5am, on the dot. Either I must have trained myself to wake up this early from previous times I’d visited, or there is something that changes at 5am and somehow triggers my unconscious to wake up. What else is strange but very welcome? Having a dresser again and not having to dig through my suitcase every time I need a pair of socks. Obviously, I am looking forward to having my own place with A., excited to pick out furniture, to decorate and make the place our own. In three weeks, I will have that opportunity. For now, I will spend as much time as I can with my friends, which, I suppose, includes waking up at 5 in the morning.
