Two years ago, I was invited to a soup party. I left this party with a big win: I now have a lazy-meal recipe, the minty green peas soup. Here are the instructions. 

1. In a pan (I like to use a wok) cook minced or diced onions with a bit of olive oil and garlic. 
2. Add (half) a bag of frozen green peas and once everything is correctly defrosted and cooked through, add water until level. 
3. Blend the lot into a soup, tossing salt and pepper, spices, but above all dried or fresh mint at the same occasion. 

Sometimes, I also add cream cheese. It's simple, tasty, and I can easily make sure I have all the ingredients. I like the idea that I can twist it easily. It can be a warm soup in cold seasons, or a refreshing one, served cold, in the Summer.
