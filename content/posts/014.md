Once upon a time, and sometimes still these days when I am particularly inspired, I wanted to be a carpenter. The idea of making useful things, practical things out of wood was very attractive. These days, it is easy to find short videos of people showing you how to make a “simple” bookcase or a “simple” planter’s box. “Simple,” put simply, seems to be broadly interpreted. The average person does not have a table saw, a jointer, and a drill press just lying around. The prerequisites are often extensive. Luckily, I discovered Woodworking for Mere Mortals which relies less on acquiring a stockpile of tools and more on how someone can learn and do everything they need to with a limited budget and limited space. I’m getting great ideas to spruce up our future apartment!
