People often think the word “incredible” has a positive connotation, whereas etymologically speaking, in + credibilis means not believable. Thus, the true meaning is difficult or impossible to believe. This definition, I think, most aptly describes the political environment over the last 8 years. How is it possible Trump came to power? Do I really believe France is about to elect the RN hate group? Has Giorgia Meloni brough fascism back to Italy? It seems incredible, this polarization into the far left and the extreme right. Like the American middle class, centrists no longer exist. All must take a stance and defend it, knowing the other side refuses to parley. Today, we can breathe a sigh of relief, but the trajectory is increasingly charged – how long before it ruptures?
