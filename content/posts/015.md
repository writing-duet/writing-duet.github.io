Growing plants in a garden has been on my mind for several years. I enjoy helping my sister in her farm when I visit her, and of course I hold good memories of harvesting my parents' garden -even my first jobs in fields as a teenager are synonyms with hardwork but enjoyable times: harvesting garlic, detasseling corn, etc. But I've actually never had the occasion to be really in charge of a garden: there was always someone else more responsible, more involved than me for the day-to-day care, the weeding, the watering, etc. I've never even had the equipment, the space and the time or the motivation, all of that at once. This Summer is different: we're trying to grow basil and tomatoes in M.'s garden for his return. I hope to get to eat some of it!
