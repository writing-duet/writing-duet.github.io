McMindfulness is the concept of the commodification of mindful practices to remedy the consequences for societal acceleration. Mindfulness holds space as a counter-movement to the ever “upwards” and “onwards” path for corporate individuals, however it risks exacerbating the problem by being utilized as a “functional deceleration” allowing for higher performance and further acceleration. Corporate entities are transforming stress and burnout into individual problems and not a collective problem at the societal and structural level. This releases them from working on improving stress and burnout-inducing conditions in the workplace. Mindfulness has allowed corporations to pursue corporate objectives and commercial profit disguised as caring for an individual.
