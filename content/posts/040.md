Inequalities come in all shapes and sizes. I’m reading a book about Canadian history and there’s a lot of emphasis on maintaining good relations with the Indians. But I just discovered why Quebec was so successful with the Algonquin and Montagnais: they cheated. While in the rival Mohawk tribe’s territory, Samuel de Champain and two associates used arquebuses -never before seen by the Indians- and in a matter of seconds murdered all the chiefs and senior warriors. When the remaining Mohawk’s fled, the French settlers let the Montagnais viciously torture their prisoners: tearing out nails and entrails, force-feeding sliced up hearts of their relatives, etc… I wonder how many Quebecois would still point out their native relations if they knew how much blood was shed to obtain it.
