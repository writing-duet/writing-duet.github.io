Pick up, bend down, do it over. Pull, no pull harder. Dirt flying everywhere. Sweat dripping into my eyes. Ants crawling up my arms and legs. If I stand up too fast, my vision goes black. The past week I have exhausted myself with yardwork. Mowing, pulling weeds, cutting back bushes, pruning trees, and filling bag after bag of yard waste. In the evenings, my hands feel sore and stiff, how I would imagine it might be in 40 years. In the mornings, my hamstrings are so taut I have to take time to stretch before attempting to bend over. Why am I putting in all this effort if I never even wanted a yard in the first place? Well, it is nice to have a task that shows the results of my efforts. If I keep busy moving that leaves less time for thinking and stressing.
