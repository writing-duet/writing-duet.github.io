I used to go on hikes with my sister when she came out to work remotely during the pandemic. In the rural Midwest it was easy to find trails where you wouldn’t encounter another sole the entire day you were out there. We spotted mushrooms, identified plants, watched the colors of the leaves change as the season progressed. I saw more of the state with her than I had seen since I’d first arrived years ago. I didn’t fully appreciate it though – if we were still trekking after 5pm I would get frustrated that I would miss my chance to call my fiancée. I could kind of be a pain about it. I didn’t appreciate enough the hikes and the time we were spending together. Looking back, those are some of the fondest memories I have of living there.
