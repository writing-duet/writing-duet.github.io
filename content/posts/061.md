It would be rude of me not to insist on "my strengths", I was told today. A chaotic mind makes you flexible and less afraid of change, which, indeed, is not a weakness. I was also told today to "embrace the doubts". In fact, I've now written the formula on a Post-it note, destined to be stuck on the wall in front of my desk. Embracing the doubts, dwelling on the uncharted territories of my expertise, accepting that I continue to learn: this mantra shall lead the way to more freedom and self-affirmation as a researcher. M told me that I shouldn't think that a PhD thesis is written to please anyone, least of all my supervisors: it should please *me*. It is a seductive challenge, especially as I try to rectify my people-pleaser habits.
