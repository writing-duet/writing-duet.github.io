I read somewhere that people in Texas are getting “Summertime SAD.” When I think about seasonal affective disorder, I’ve never considered it to be applicable outside of winter, perhaps early spring. Basically, when it is dark and wet. Normal summers are anti-SAD with blue skies, warm, dry breezes, bright sunshine, etc., etc... It turns out that this is typical weather in places along the southern US states. By contrast, in their summers the heat skyrockets to a point where it is oppressive and quite seriously dangerous to be outside for any moderate length of time. So, whereas the northern parts of North America hunker down in the winter and spring, the southern parts seek refuge in full summer. So far, I like the north - I’m pretty happy with the Quebec summer weather even if I know Winter Is Coming.
