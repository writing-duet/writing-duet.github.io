I used to live with someone who would, in stores, replace the sticker of some fancy cheese with a sticker obtained after weighing the right amount of vegetables. Then they would use the self checkout, and enjoy the cheese along with their Sunday brunch. It could hardly be considered an item of first necessity, so they were really doing it just for the thrill of cheating the rules. A few months ago, I saw a couple of people trying the same trick and getting caught: it doesn't always work. Some people may find this outrageous, but I think it would be naive to imagine that no one cheats or steals. I think cheating is part of the system and cannot be eliminated. Ideally though, it would be an outlet to compensate inequalities, not encourage them.
