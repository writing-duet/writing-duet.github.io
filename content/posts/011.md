This morning, the radio reminded me that today is the beginning of Summer. "Hard to believe with the rains we've known lately, and yet..." They said. Here in Montreal, it seems more believable: we've been going through a heatwave for a few days. It's the kind of weather that could make me desperate for an intensity control button. Nine years ago, days for days, J. and I were also caught in terrible temperatures: we had just arrived in Las Vegas after spending two days at the Grand Canyon. It was at least 45°C during the day and, while we spent the night on The Strip, the temperatures didn't drop below 38°C. I had bought a nice big water bottle at the Grand Canyon visitor center because I didn't have any. This week, this very bottle broke.
