Attention spans are getting smaller and smaller, it seems. Whether it is a matter of getting older and naturally having more responsibilities to keep track of, or a symptom of the “attention economy” continuously bombarding everyone with advertisements, trying to focus on a single task can sometimes feel like a workout. It is well known that attention is not infinite: I personally run into this after spending a day speaking a non-native language or performing some action with heavy manual labor – my brain will refuse to continue translating in the first case and zone off in the second. Usually though, I am just running around juggling a bunch of priorities in my head, unable to devote too much attention to one without risking losing all the others.
