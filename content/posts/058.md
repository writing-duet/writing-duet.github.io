Breakfast of champions is often used in irony these days, but it used to be the slogan for Wheaties cereal. Now, someone will say it just before tipping back their 5-shot espresso latte. But is it better to eat breakfast, the supposedly “most important meal of the day” or to engage in intermittent fasting, which is supposed to help one’s body produce ketosis and encourage breaking down fat stores? Not only are there proponents on both sides, but there is also always another fad around the corner: keto, paeleo, atkins, whole30, master cleanse, etc.  Seems like a new one every year, and it is hard to know which would work for you until you commit to trying one. Well, I suppose I’ll just pick one since my scale gave me an update on my weight compared to two years ago.
