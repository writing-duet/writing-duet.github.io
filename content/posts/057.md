"Morning'" says the woman as she enters the elevator. The father and daughter inside nod in response. She never knows if she's supposed to greet strangers in elevators: the culture is different from one country to the next. The elevator stops on three more floors, and it's a small crowd which now exits on the third floor. Politely, they all discretely race to be the first to join the line at the hotel's breakfast. When she checked in earlier that week, she was pleasantly surprised to hear that "breakfast's free!" She was used to pay an extra 15 to 20$. Now, considering the line to grab a simple bagle and some creamcheese to spread -and the fight for a seat at a table that will follow-, she's considering the benefits of a more exclusive breakfast.
