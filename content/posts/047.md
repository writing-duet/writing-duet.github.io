In the Harry Potter series, one invention I which existed for real is (I'm sure you'd have guessed it) the Timeturner. It's an enchanted necklace which allows its user to turn it upside down as many times as the number of hours they which to go back in time. I could use it like Hermione to study more topics or read more books. But I would also use it to go outside and enjoy the sun, lying down in the grass or weeding the garden, while also spending the day on my computer. There are so many things we can do on a computer connected to the internet. I'd actually have time to work on all the little side projects I keep thinking of but, realistic with how much time I have, don't start. Oh, if only I could duplicate myself a few hours every week!
