Google knows at least two solid decades of my life: my oldest email in Gmail dates from January 2008, it was imported from my previous "teenager" email address. I have sorted through these old emails some years ago, but there are many for which I can't resolve to press that "delete" button. Here's the dilemna: do I really need to keep that message from A.R. sent on April 20th, 2009, sharing the report on the high school student board meeting? Meh, probably not, but what if my future self decides one day to go back and explore who I was as a teenager? I'll remember and curse myself for sending all of this to the trash. As I'm writing this, a crazy solution comes to my mind: I could export and upcycle all of this into an ePub for my own usage.
