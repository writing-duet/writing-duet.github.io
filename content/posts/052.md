Exploration of Lake Superior is fascinating. Apparently, the water quantity in Lake Superior alone can cover the entire northern and southern Americas up to 30cm. Having driven across the US, I have a hard time believing this is true, yet I have also bathed in Lake Superior several times and know that the lake is so deep that the water never gets warmer than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8C). It’s hard to get a grasp of the immensity: 12,100km^2 of water, 10% of the Earth’s fresh surface water, 3 quadrillion gallons. The surface of Lake Superior is more than the areas of Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire combined. If every person in the world drank half a gallon of its water per day, it would take 2,348 years to empty. It’s mind-boggling!
