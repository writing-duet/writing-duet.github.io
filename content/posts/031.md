So, I am free to do as I please. However, I guess being free in my choices is guaranteed when I actually do have a choice. As we are looking for solutions to our for-ever-dragging temporary housing situation -I swear I'd never thought it would take so long to move to this city...- I feel like even though we keep our mind open, there simply isn't much choice. This lack of options makes me feel restricted in my freedom: I'm embracing Montr√©al and what it has to offer, and yet, Marketplace, Kijiji and Airbnb are just screaming back at me that there's something seriously wrong with the housing market in this city. The search engines are inadapted, the apartments are old, moldy and expensive, the tenants are scammy or irresponsive. Let's just keep hoping.
