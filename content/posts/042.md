Textbooks I once thought were a thing of the past. I’m done with university, so why am I still reading textbooks when I have so many other books I want to read? Let’s talk numbers: currently there are 283 books in my To Be Read (TBR) pile. If I usually take 11 days to finish a book (in 2024) and I am currently in various stages of reading 15 books, how long before I get my TBR down to zero? For simplicity let’s say that the in-process books are collectively 25% finished, so there are 8.25 days until they are done. The remaining 283 books will take another 3,113 days, or 8.53 years to get through. That’s not even considering the textbooks I read to learn new skills or the AML research papers to stay current! What if I discover more books I want to read?
