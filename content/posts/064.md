Discipline with Chinese Cinnamon is not something I thought I would need to pay attention to as a grown up. Cinnamon is well known for its wide-ranging health properties, from blood sugar lowering effects to increasing insulin sensitivity. As someone who used to eat cinnamon-heavy dishes at least once a week, I thought, “great, that’s one more way I am trying to eat healthier.” Now, thanks to social media, I realize this is debatable. Cassia cinnamon, better know as Chinese cinnamon, contains high concentrations of a compound called coumarin which is linked to kidney, liver, and lung damage. Ceylon cinnamon, by contrast, contains 250x less of this compound. Which one do you think is found in typical grocery stores? Yep, Cassia. At least I eat less cinnamon now, I guess.
