This text could have been another one. Every day, we think about different topics for these texts, try, erase, try again, change topic. I try not to think too much about what I write: I want to favor spontaneity. What makes today a little special, is that I'm using a new keyboard. Split in two, it makes me painfully aware of how much territory my right hand normally covers on the keyboard. Today, I went from 54 wpm to less than 14. My pace at correctly punching the keys gives me ample time to think about each of these characters. I could have talked about other things: roasted marshmallows over a bonfire, my incapacity to stop working in the evening, a list of furniture I'm considering for the future. Tell me, reader, what is your pick?
