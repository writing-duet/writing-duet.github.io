Cultural differences appear in many instances of our daily 
life. But when you spend enough time with someone who grew up 
in a different culture, you slowly forget about your initial 
cultural standards. With the force of habit, the outcome of the 
confrontation (or fusion) of your culture and the other's 
becomes a new norm. The next cultural clash might as well 
happen with someone who grew up in the same culture as you: in 
the same fashion, sometimes I simply can't remember what 
something is called in my mother tongue when I speak to a 
French person. I think food is certainly more resistent to 
these cultural adaptations. I can get used to eating guacamole 
more often, but I surely can't wrap my head around considering 
quiches only a breakfast meal.
