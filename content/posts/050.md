Summer Olympics have officially kicked off in Paris and my social media is full of video comparisons of current Olympic feats and historic ones. Its incredible to see the difference between what was record breaking 50 years ago and the insane performances the athletes are accomplishing today. On a wider scale, it speaks to the hyper-specialization of the athletes and the unique genetic mutations that allow for one individual to excel above all others: the ACE, ACTN3, EPO, and COL1A1 genes have all been responsible for Olympic metals. Couple that with the fact that the Olympic Village is known for being a hotbed of hookups (puns intended) and I am beginning to shape a conspiracy theory that the Olympic Games have evolved into a eugenics experiment.
