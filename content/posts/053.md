"Boggling" translates to "ahurissant" in French. I had to look it up. I actually know the word in another context: it's the name of a game I would play during Christmas at my grand-parents'. Boggle. The game had you shake a 5Ã—5 grid of dice, with a different letter on each side and the goal was to find as many words as possible using these letters. It's funny to realize how many games we have with words involved, especially as kids: guessing a word I'm thinking of, the "petit bac" where for a series of different categories (animals, cities or countries, etc.) you have to think of words starting with a given letter. You only get points if no one has thought of the same words as you. Today, I find myself playing Wordle and the New York Times' games.
