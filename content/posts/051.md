I love experimenting, it is my favorite way to discover a new tool, environment or concept. But, since I'm perfectly happy with the idea of experimenting for the sake of experimentation, combibining things to see the output, just because it's possible, even if the outcome could have been predicted *in theory*, often I get caught up by the feeling that I could have used my time in a smarter way. As in I could have learned as much had I done more research ahead of time or, simply, had I read the manual. During a phD, I'm told two injections which can be hard to combine: I should be free to experiment however I want, it's probably the free-est I'll ever be, but it should also be planned ahead. I want room for instinctive hands-on exploration!
