Am I becoming a Karen? Perhaps. Every day I walk along the perimeter of M.’s yard and pull out the trash people throw onto his property. Wine bottles, bags of chips, juice boxes, sunglasses, all kinds of plastic/cardboard packaging and so, so many beer cans. I kick them into the street next to the cars in a vain attempt to make people realize just how much they are littering. In truth, I want to place them under the wipers or wheels to make sure that the visitors are affected by their own filth. On my end, I have to move it to maintain the property - the first time I mowed I ran over a pair of sunglasses and shot plastic and glass in all directions, some hitting my own hat and glasses. Other times plastic has gotten wrapped around the blade, and I’d had to stop and un-jam it. Now I notice even the smallest scrap.
