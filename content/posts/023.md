I could dwell longer on old memories as I have in the past couple of posts, but I want to stop and appreciate the current days. It is not easy: I feel like I'm waiting on so many things to settle. The politics in France, more dreadful than ever, the answers after our applications to apartments, knowing where will be our next home, and then, the rest, the furnishing, the building new habits, new projects. And yet, here we are, the two of us in that house that isn't ours, living through the Summer. With walks by the river, with watching the tomatoes popping up on the branches (they'll turn red soon) and the weeds growing, and the repeated gesture of unrolling that watering hose every night. For sure, that gesture, we'll forget when the Summer is over.
