Aphantasia is a characteristic where someone doesn’t form or use mental images as part of the thinking or imagination process: if someone asked you to picture a hummingbird, or an Alaskan landscape, could you? Some people can’t, and it is not a disease or medical condition, it is just one way brains process information. Intriguingly, there are different degrees of aphantasia, from having the equivalent of 4k HD mental images to thinking about what you are supposed to visualize, but not seeing anything. What’s more, there are even different subgroups, such as the inability to imagine objects versus landscapes. I suppose I am lucky – I can recall exactly where something was that I read on a page, but if you ask me to picture a soccer ball, I can barely generate a colored circle. Guess which one helped me more in school?
