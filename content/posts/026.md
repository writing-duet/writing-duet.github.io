Is Earth round? Some people say no. These “Flat Earthers” believe the Earth is disc or diamond-shaped and surrounded completely by an Antarctica ice wall. This concept originated with British writer Samuel Rowbotham around 1849, who argued “the bible supported the idea that the earth was flat and immoveable, and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture.” Setting aside the fact that the current canonical stories of the bible were written by humans up to 400 years after the timing of their topic, what else do these humans conjecture? Well, it varies wildly: some don’t believe in outer space, some believe in an infinite plane, and others believe atheists are trying to use science to suppress their religion.
