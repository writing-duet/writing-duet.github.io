Is waking up past 10 AM on a Sunday lazy? Last night you said: "I don't put an alarm, I'll wake up when I wake up." You earned it, you said, having woken up at 6 to go on a run, before going on a hike with me. I agree. I remember a time, soon after the first Covid confinement, when everybody was trying to get back to exercising or walking every day. My employer had created a team challenge: through an app, it added up each team's daily steps. Some days, the app was just unashamedly sharing with my colleagues that I'd had one of those lazy days.
