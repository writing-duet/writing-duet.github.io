Sometimes I wonder if it wouldn’t be better to annotate our lives. Write down daily summaries to remind ourselves of what we have done, who we need to get back to, and what we need to do in the near future. Little daily messages to ourselves. Most people would probably say it’s easy – make a journal, put in a calendar reminder for follow-up messages or write a to-do list. None of these really solve the problem themselves, which is that sometimes all the moving parts are too numerous or moving too fast to keep track of, so the solution is not to add more responsibilities, more parts that require updating. However, without some sort of aid, things can fall through the cracks. Messages get left unanswered, on read.
