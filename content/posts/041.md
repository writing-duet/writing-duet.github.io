Individual responsiblities can be at the forefront to ensure the success of an enterprise. Take this writing project for example: if J. doesn't post a text on time, I can't work on mine. It works the other way around of course: if I get overwhelmed by other things (e.g. stress) and stop writing and posting, J. can't write in my place and I put this project at risk of an early stop. How do we make sure this keeps on working? How do we make sure that this project -which we thought wouldn't be such a burdden on a daily basis- is not prematurely abandonned if we take vacations, if we get separated by travels for a few days or weeks, if, simply, it stops being enough of a priority and one wakes up at 1 AM thinking "shout! I forgot to post my text!"?
