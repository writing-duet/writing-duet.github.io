Many towns and streets are named after saints in France or in Canada. Growing up, I've got used to these names in France, to the point that I'm often barely aware of their religious origins. In my mind, "Saint-Remi" refers to a specific spot in my hometown, not to a saint or a martyr. In Montreal, however, the omnipresence of christian names sometimes feels overwhelming. There are historical reasons for that, of course, but I recently realized that the reason I'm so aware of it is because the saints here have different names than in France. For example, I had never heard the name "Zotique" before coming here. Unfortunately, my investigation to find out where the name comes from won't go far tonight: there's no entry for 'Zotique' on Wikipedia.
