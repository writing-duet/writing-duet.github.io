# Writing Duet Project

- a post every day, alternating the narrator
- a year long comitment
- a connection between a post and the next one
- a title for each post
- about 750 characters for each post


## Steps

1. go to https://github.com/writing-duet/writing-duet.github.io/tree/main/content/posts
2. create a new file `000.md` (each day we increase by 1)
3. add the following header before typing the text:

```
+++
title = "YOUR TITLE"
date = YYYY-MM-DD
+++
```

4. commit the result!
5. just wait for the website to built and deploy
