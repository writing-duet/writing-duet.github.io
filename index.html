                    <p>Discipline with Chinese Cinnamon is not something I thought I would need to pay attention to as a grown up. Cinnamon is well known for its wide-ranging health properties, from blood sugar lowering effects to increasing insulin sensitivity. As someone who used to eat cinnamon-heavy dishes at least once a week, I thought, “great, that’s one more way I am trying to eat healthier.” Now, thanks to social media, I realize this is debatable. Cassia cinnamon, better know as Chinese cinnamon, contains high concentrations of a compound called coumarin which is linked to kidney, liver, and lung damage. Ceylon cinnamon, by contrast, contains 250x less of this compound. Which one do you think is found in typical grocery stores? Yep, Cassia. At least I eat less cinnamon now, I guess.</p>

                    <p>I have la fâcheuse habit de finish my Duolingo lesson at midnight moins une. And yet, I have conservé a streak for nearly 1200 days by now. Mille deux cent jours. That's un peu plus de three years. Je speak English and Français every day, switching between the two langages without toujours realizing it, but I have utilisé Duolingo to practice (I say practice and not apprendre on purpose) English, Italiano, русский язык, український алфавіт mais aussi ελληνικό αλφάβητο, Esperanto, and Espagnol. Some of them, I already spoke(-ish ou quasi) and essayais just de réapprendre, other, I was discovering. Parfois (often), I wonder quel est le point: I could utiliser cette daily poignée de minutes pour autre chose. I guess it make me feel like I have discipline.</p>

                    <p>Habits come and go, but habit trackers take up space forever. So do the tens of thousands of photos currently sitting on my phone, computers, hard drives, and cloud storage. Will I ever do something with them? Yes, probably. But do I have to sort and make severe cuts in what I actually keep? Absolutely. But it is not only a problem with how many: over the years the file size also get increasingly larger. Same with to do lists, exercise logs, etc. While it can be interesting to know what we do day-to-day, we don’t need an app that takes up way more space. In fact, using an app makes it less likely that we would take a look back on the files we are saving. What we attempt to preserve, in reality, becomes hidden and eventually lost.</p>

                    <p>It would be rude of me not to insist on &quot;my strengths&quot;, I was told today. A chaotic mind makes you flexible and less afraid of change, which, indeed, is not a weakness. I was also told today to &quot;embrace the doubts&quot;. In fact, I've now written the formula on a Post-it note, destined to be stuck on the wall in front of my desk. Embracing the doubts, dwelling on the uncharted territories of my expertise, accepting that I continue to learn: this mantra shall lead the way to more freedom and self-affirmation as a researcher. M told me that I shouldn't think that a PhD thesis is written to please anyone, least of all my supervisors: it should please <em>me</em>. It is a seductive challenge, especially as I try to rectify my people-pleaser habits.</p>

                    <p>Predictable things can be boring, except when it is something you have planned ahead. Sometimes a change in the plan is just rude. For example, today we got our first online order from a store that was impossibly annoying to set up. In fact, it was supposed to be delivered yesterday but they blew it off. Today, I check my email for updates every 30 minutes or so until I see the familiar “sometime before the end of the day” status arrive. Fantastic. Well, good thing I left the building earlier this afternoon because without giving me any update they left the packages by the entrance, not secured behind a locked door. A place where anyone walking by can just grab them and take off. Like I said, sometimes it is just plain rude.</p>

                    <p>Two years ago, one month ago... time flies and it's often tempting to pretend it doesn't. I feel stupid every time I commit to be better organized, and it eventually falls through. I admire and at the same time am frightened by organized minds: M seems to have a vision, a model already set when he starts a project; J thinks things through; A and R talk and it's so clear, paced and organized that you would think they're reading notes. They already know where their sentence go. I am carried by instinct and chaos. I have a general idea of where I'm headed but I can take detour, I can hop over obstacles and miss some of the course, my destination might remain the same, or it might change, but the journey, save for its chaotic nature, is not predictable.</p>

                    <p>Breakfast of champions is often used in irony these days, but it used to be the slogan for Wheaties cereal. Now, someone will say it just before tipping back their 5-shot espresso latte. But is it better to eat breakfast, the supposedly “most important meal of the day” or to engage in intermittent fasting, which is supposed to help one’s body produce ketosis and encourage breaking down fat stores? Not only are there proponents on both sides, but there is also always another fad around the corner: keto, paeleo, atkins, whole30, master cleanse, etc.  Seems like a new one every year, and it is hard to know which would work for you until you commit to trying one. Well, I suppose I’ll just pick one since my scale gave me an update on my weight compared to two years ago.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Morning'&quot; says the woman as she enters the elevator. The father and daughter inside nod in response. She never knows if she's supposed to greet strangers in elevators: the culture is different from one country to the next. The elevator stops on three more floors, and it's a small crowd which now exits on the third floor. Politely, they all discretely race to be the first to join the line at the hotel's breakfast. When she checked in earlier that week, she was pleasantly surprised to hear that &quot;breakfast's free!&quot; She was used to pay an extra 15 to 20$. Now, considering the line to grab a simple bagle and some creamcheese to spread -and the fight for a seat at a table that will follow-, she's considering the benefits of a more exclusive breakfast. </p>

                    <p>Blatantly disregarding my exhaustion and need for sleep, my second day at S. and M.’s house finds me waking up at 5am, on the dot. Either I must have trained myself to wake up this early from previous times I’d visited, or there is something that changes at 5am and somehow triggers my unconscious to wake up. What else is strange but very welcome? Having a dresser again and not having to dig through my suitcase every time I need a pair of socks. Obviously, I am looking forward to having my own place with A., excited to pick out furniture, to decorate and make the place our own. In three weeks, I will have that opportunity. For now, I will spend as much time as I can with my friends, which, I suppose, includes waking up at 5 in the morning.</p>

                    <p>&quot;King is to Queen, what man is to woman.&quot; This example is often used in Natural Language Processing papers to show that language models are capable of forming a semantic space which allows them to &quot;understand&quot; the world. But biases exist in all of these language models: the biases are cultural, racists, sexists, you name it. Today at a conference I atend, someone showed that according to GPT, it is also true to say that &quot;housemaker&quot; is to &quot;programmer&quot; what woman is to man. Nothing surprising: even before the advent of LLMs and ChatGPT, NLP specialists have been studying how biased AI models are. Today, the spontaneous &quot;oh!&quot; that collectively escaped the lips of the audience shows that most of them didn't think these biases could be so blatant.</p>

                    <p>Game Master is one of the roles of TTRPGs that I have always held in awe. When I was in college, I used to meet with a group weekly to play Mage, Exalted, Werewolf, and Deadlands. The game master was phenomenal: he knew the ins and outs of all the lore and the stories told were always incredibly rich with detail. Since I’ve moved away, I had looked for another group to join for the same games, but those are now considered “retro.”  Now, to play the TTRPGs I want to, I have to create my own group, be my own GM, and find world systems that I can imagine spending hours in, mastering the mechanics and lore. I missed the relaunch of the “retro” Mage kickstarter, but maybe I can make up for it with Brandon Sanderson’s new TTRPG for The Way of Kings.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Boggling&quot; translates to &quot;ahurissant&quot; in French. I had to look it up. I actually know the word in another context: it's the name of a game I would play during Christmas at my grand-parents'. Boggle. The game had you shake a 5×5 grid of dice, with a different letter on each side and the goal was to find as many words as possible using these letters. It's funny to realize how many games we have with words involved, especially as kids: guessing a word I'm thinking of, the &quot;petit bac&quot; where for a series of different categories (animals, cities or countries, etc.) you have to think of words starting with a given letter. You only get points if no one has thought of the same words as you. Today, I find myself playing Wordle and the New York Times' games.</p>

                    <p>Exploration of Lake Superior is fascinating. Apparently, the water quantity in Lake Superior alone can cover the entire northern and southern Americas up to 30cm. Having driven across the US, I have a hard time believing this is true, yet I have also bathed in Lake Superior several times and know that the lake is so deep that the water never gets warmer than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8C). It’s hard to get a grasp of the immensity: 12,100km^2 of water, 10% of the Earth’s fresh surface water, 3 quadrillion gallons. The surface of Lake Superior is more than the areas of Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire combined. If every person in the world drank half a gallon of its water per day, it would take 2,348 years to empty. It’s mind-boggling!</p>

                    <p>I love experimenting, it is my favorite way to discover a new tool, environment or concept. But, since I'm perfectly happy with the idea of experimenting for the sake of experimentation, combibining things to see the output, just because it's possible, even if the outcome could have been predicted <em>in theory</em>, often I get caught up by the feeling that I could have used my time in a smarter way. As in I could have learned as much had I done more research ahead of time or, simply, had I read the manual. During a phD, I'm told two injections which can be hard to combine: I should be free to experiment however I want, it's probably the free-est I'll ever be, but it should also be planned ahead. I want room for instinctive hands-on exploration!</p>

                    <p>Summer Olympics have officially kicked off in Paris and my social media is full of video comparisons of current Olympic feats and historic ones. Its incredible to see the difference between what was record breaking 50 years ago and the insane performances the athletes are accomplishing today. On a wider scale, it speaks to the hyper-specialization of the athletes and the unique genetic mutations that allow for one individual to excel above all others: the ACE, ACTN3, EPO, and COL1A1 genes have all been responsible for Olympic metals. Couple that with the fact that the Olympic Village is known for being a hotbed of hookups (puns intended) and I am beginning to shape a conspiracy theory that the Olympic Games have evolved into a eugenics experiment.</p>

                    <p>Two years ago, I was invited to a soup party. I left this party with a big win: I now have a lazy-meal recipe, the minty green peas soup. Here are the instructions. </p>
<ol>
<li>In a pan (I like to use a wok) cook minced or diced onions with a bit of olive oil and garlic. </li>
<li>Add (half) a bag of frozen green peas and once everything is correctly defrosted and cooked through, add water until level. </li>
<li>Blend the lot into a soup, tossing salt and pepper, spices, but above all dried or fresh mint at the same occasion. </li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, I also add cream cheese. It's simple, tasty, and I can easily make sure I have all the ingredients. I like the idea that I can twist it easily. It can be a warm soup in cold seasons, or a refreshing one, served cold, in the Summer.</p>

                    <p>Week after week flies by and there are a hundred new things I’ve wanted to do but haven’t committed the time to actually doing. I would love to write a book, and I have a few ideas for a storyline. I would be happy to learn another language other than French, but I don’t start because I am worried it will mess up my already precarious knowledge of conversational French, just how French did to my knowledge of Spanish. I would like to plan out the interior design for our next apartment, but I don’t do this either. Not even the hummus recipe I am so looking forward to eating: I fail to do these side projects when now is the moment when I have time for them. Time keeps marching forward and the opportunities I should take advantage of fly right on by.</p>

                    <p>In the Harry Potter series, one invention I which existed for real is (I'm sure you'd have guessed it) the Timeturner. It's an enchanted necklace which allows its user to turn it upside down as many times as the number of hours they which to go back in time. I could use it like Hermione to study more topics or read more books. But I would also use it to go outside and enjoy the sun, lying down in the grass or weeding the garden, while also spending the day on my computer. There are so many things we can do on a computer connected to the internet. I'd actually have time to work on all the little side projects I keep thinking of but, realistic with how much time I have, don't start. Oh, if only I could duplicate myself a few hours every week! </p>

                    <p>Pick up, bend down, do it over. Pull, no pull harder. Dirt flying everywhere. Sweat dripping into my eyes. Ants crawling up my arms and legs. If I stand up too fast, my vision goes black. The past week I have exhausted myself with yardwork. Mowing, pulling weeds, cutting back bushes, pruning trees, and filling bag after bag of yard waste. In the evenings, my hands feel sore and stiff, how I would imagine it might be in 40 years. In the mornings, my hamstrings are so taut I have to take time to stretch before attempting to bend over. Why am I putting in all this effort if I never even wanted a yard in the first place? Well, it is nice to have a task that shows the results of my efforts. If I keep busy moving that leaves less time for thinking and stressing.</p>

                    <p>This text could have been another one. Every day, we think about different topics for these texts, try, erase, try again, change topic. I try not to think too much about what I write: I want to favor spontaneity. What makes today a little special, is that I'm using a new keyboard. Split in two, it makes me painfully aware of how much territory my right hand normally covers on the keyboard. Today, I went from 54 wpm to less than 14. My pace at correctly punching the keys gives me ample time to think about each of these characters. I could have talked about other things: roasted marshmallows over a bonfire, my incapacity to stop working in the evening, a list of furniture I'm considering for the future. Tell me, reader, what is your pick?</p>

                    <p>Attention spans are getting smaller and smaller, it seems. Whether it is a matter of getting older and naturally having more responsibilities to keep track of, or a symptom of the “attention economy” continuously bombarding everyone with advertisements, trying to focus on a single task can sometimes feel like a workout. It is well known that attention is not infinite: I personally run into this after spending a day speaking a non-native language or performing some action with heavy manual labor – my brain will refuse to continue translating in the first case and zone off in the second. Usually though, I am just running around juggling a bunch of priorities in my head, unable to devote too much attention to one without risking losing all the others. </p>

                    <p>I am always impressed with my colleagues who are able to answer their emails within a week. On my part, I can quickly build an embarassing backlog of emails, some of which have been waiting for an answer for a few months. I have stopped beating myself about it, it would be too much to worry about and if I choose to keep afloat with responding to these emails, it would be by sacrificing other things I want or need to do. I think my strategy now has become to respond to older messages whenever I have time to, and otherwise to consider that if it is important or urgent, I'll receive a follow up message. Then it's no longer my responsibility to keep up with my emails, but my contact's to insist if they thought I didn't pay enough attention.</p>

                    <p>Textbooks I once thought were a thing of the past. I’m done with university, so why am I still reading textbooks when I have so many other books I want to read? Let’s talk numbers: currently there are 283 books in my To Be Read (TBR) pile. If I usually take 11 days to finish a book (in 2024) and I am currently in various stages of reading 15 books, how long before I get my TBR down to zero? For simplicity let’s say that the in-process books are collectively 25% finished, so there are 8.25 days until they are done. The remaining 283 books will take another 3,113 days, or 8.53 years to get through. That’s not even considering the textbooks I read to learn new skills or the AML research papers to stay current! What if I discover more books I want to read? </p>

                    <p>Individual responsiblities can be at the forefront to ensure the success of an enterprise. Take this writing project for example: if J. doesn't post a text on time, I can't work on mine. It works the other way around of course: if I get overwhelmed by other things (e.g. stress) and stop writing and posting, J. can't write in my place and I put this project at risk of an early stop. How do we make sure this keeps on working? How do we make sure that this project -which we thought wouldn't be such a burdden on a daily basis- is not prematurely abandonned if we take vacations, if we get separated by travels for a few days or weeks, if, simply, it stops being enough of a priority and one wakes up at 1 AM thinking &quot;shout! I forgot to post my text!&quot;?</p>

                    <p>McMindfulness is the concept of the commodification of mindful practices to remedy the consequences for societal acceleration. Mindfulness holds space as a counter-movement to the ever “upwards” and “onwards” path for corporate individuals, however it risks exacerbating the problem by being utilized as a “functional deceleration” allowing for higher performance and further acceleration. Corporate entities are transforming stress and burnout into individual problems and not a collective problem at the societal and structural level. This releases them from working on improving stress and burnout-inducing conditions in the workplace. Mindfulness has allowed corporations to pursue corporate objectives and commercial profit disguised as caring for an individual.</p>

                    <p>I used to live with someone who would, in stores, replace the sticker of some fancy cheese with a sticker obtained after weighing the right amount of vegetables. Then they would use the self checkout, and enjoy the cheese along with their Sunday brunch. It could hardly be considered an item of first necessity, so they were really doing it just for the thrill of cheating the rules. A few months ago, I saw a couple of people trying the same trick and getting caught: it doesn't always work. Some people may find this outrageous, but I think it would be naive to imagine that no one cheats or steals. I think cheating is part of the system and cannot be eliminated. Ideally though, it would be an outlet to compensate inequalities, not encourage them.</p>

                    <p>Today is Prime Day, and while it might not be a hallmark of capitalism, it is still a massive event for amazon customers. The gist: two days each year amazon deeply discounts a bunch of products, giving their own brands the best deals and ads. But there is a major issue many of these big-box retailers are exploiting to scam customers – they artificially inflate the prices in the “previous price” section so when the discount is calculated, it seems like a better deal and pressures the customers into making a purchase. Grocery stores have been doing something similar with meat products: marking an incorrect weight on the packaging/label which the customer then pays for without knowing they are paying double. I don’t understand how these scams can be so prevalent.</p>

                    <p>I read an article the other day where a journalist wondered whether it was a good idea to have kids participate in actions to clean beaches. The argument against was that this solution to plastic pollution of beaches and water in general is part of a bigger orchestration from bigger industries to make cleaning an individual problem as opposed to a systemic issue greatly encouraged by big producing firms. The individual tossing their wrapping paper outside of the trash can is thus the tree who hides a forest of massive polluters. As in many other domains, I despair that the current society which results in the explosion of communities into smaller and smaller units of individual consumers makes it so difficult to stand together to make changes happen.</p>

                    <p>Am I becoming a Karen? Perhaps. Every day I walk along the perimeter of M.’s yard and pull out the trash people throw onto his property. Wine bottles, bags of chips, juice boxes, sunglasses, all kinds of plastic/cardboard packaging and so, so many beer cans. I kick them into the street next to the cars in a vain attempt to make people realize just how much they are littering. In truth, I want to place them under the wipers or wheels to make sure that the visitors are affected by their own filth. On my end, I have to move it to maintain the property - the first time I mowed I ran over a pair of sunglasses and shot plastic and glass in all directions, some hitting my own hat and glasses. Other times plastic has gotten wrapped around the blade, and I’d had to stop and un-jam it. Now I notice even the smallest scrap.</p>

                    <p>Google knows at least two solid decades of my life: my oldest email in Gmail dates from January 2008, it was imported from my previous &quot;teenager&quot; email address. I have sorted through these old emails some years ago, but there are many for which I can't resolve to press that &quot;delete&quot; button. Here's the dilemna: do I really need to keep that message from A.R. sent on April 20th, 2009, sharing the report on the high school student board meeting? Meh, probably not, but what if my future self decides one day to go back and explore who I was as a teenager? I'll remember and curse myself for sending all of this to the trash. As I'm writing this, a crazy solution comes to my mind: I could export and upcycle all of this into an ePub for my own usage.</p>

                    <p>Before moving to France I had to go through everything I owned and decide what I could manage to bring with me. I did this twice: once before leaving Michigan and again before shipping my stuff to France. If I were to guess, I donated/sold about 70% of what I owned: my car,  bike, camping equipment, half my books, an Instapot, a desktop computer, etc. I even dismantled three boxes worth of competitive sports trophies I had won so I could at least keep the nameplates. Despite all the effort, I still have a whole trunk full of keepsakes: youth aptitude tests, yearbooks, sports competition memorabilia, etc. While they may have zero intrinsic value, they help me remember parts of my life that are otherwise blacked out. Some things are easily forgotten.</p>

                    <p>We picked sour cherries from the trees in M's garden. Since they are too sour to be eaten fresh, I plan on turning them into jam -once I find enough jars. I don't really remember when was the first time I cooked jam, but I know my mother taught me how to sterilize the jars not that many years ago. For the longest time, from my perspective, there were two jam specialists in my family: my aunt and my grand mother. Even today, I sometimes text my aunt to get her jam recipes. From my grand mother, I have kept one jar of bitter orange marmalade that I can't resolve to through away, even though I don't think I'll ever eat it. It has followed me through several moves around Paris already: maybe one day it'll make its way into our pantry in Canada.</p>

                    <p>Home prices in Montreal are at an all-time high. Last month, the average single-family detached home sold for $614,972, a 5.4% increase over the prior year, and 52% higher than five years ago. In Toronto, the average price was $1,480,399, and in Vancouver: $2,343,282. While the price of lodgings has skyrocketed in Montreal since the pandemic, at least it is still feasible to imagine owning a home one day. I look forward to having our own space to add a wood working shop, a gaming room, a kid’s room or two with space enough for them to run around. I want a pantry where we can store all our homemade confitures and tomatoes and pickles grown from our own garden. Maybe to have all this we would have to live in the countryside. Would it be that bad? </p>

                    <p>So, I am free to do as I please. However, I guess being free in my choices is guaranteed when I actually do have a choice. As we are looking for solutions to our for-ever-dragging temporary housing situation -I swear I'd never thought it would take so long to move to this city...- I feel like even though we keep our mind open, there simply isn't much choice. This lack of options makes me feel restricted in my freedom: I'm embracing Montréal and what it has to offer, and yet, Marketplace, Kijiji and Airbnb are just screaming back at me that there's something seriously wrong with the housing market in this city. The search engines are inadapted, the apartments are old, moldy and expensive, the tenants are scammy or irresponsive. Let's just keep hoping.</p>

                    <p>Do we have control over our choices or are they made by factors outside of our control? I find the question interesting because if we focus on the scientific aspect, it necessitates thinking about how we each define our locus of control. Personally, I have a locus of control that is potentially too large – I think that I am in control of things I am actually not influencing. Therefore, I agree more with the free will side: so what if I have muscle memory or a history of acting and responding a certain way? If I am aware of it, I can decide to do otherwise. Take baking for example: I’ve always made only one loaf of banana bread, following the recipe exactly. Today, I made my first double batch, and I used different sugar, frozen bananas, and the wrong shaped pans.</p>

                    <p>This enterprise of writing a text everyday has us bound to a rhythm we shouldn't break. We agreed that there should be no rupture in the pace of posting 750 characters each day. However, sometimes the inspiration is missing. It's my turn today but, even if the day was filled with various events, somehow nothing, no thought seems worth dedicating this many characters? It's exasperating. What link can I possibly build between Meloni and the Reese's Blizzard cup I ate earlier? Is it okay to talk about Trump one day and to move on to describing pleasing memories the next? Can I talk about the mundanity of an eventless subway ride in Montreal if I don't have anything sailant to say about it? 50 characters left, it's so many and so few at once...</p>

                    <p>People often think the word “incredible” has a positive connotation, whereas etymologically speaking, in + credibilis means not believable. Thus, the true meaning is difficult or impossible to believe. This definition, I think, most aptly describes the political environment over the last 8 years. How is it possible Trump came to power? Do I really believe France is about to elect the RN hate group? Has Giorgia Meloni brought fascism back to Italy? It seems incredible, this polarization into the far left and the extreme right. Like the American middle class, centrists no longer exist. All must take a stance and defend it, knowing the other side refuses to parley. Today, we can breathe a sigh of relief, but the trajectory is increasingly charged – how long before it ruptures?</p>

                    <p>A flat disk balancing on a needle. It seems like a fitted metaphor for the nightmare that has taken place over the past weeks. Some 65 millions of people supposedly under an agreement that this balance is worth more than anything else. And yet, so many, blind, idiots and full of hatred, have decided to run as far as they can. &quot;To the edge! Beyond the edge! We've never tried that void underneath, surely it can't do any harm!&quot; And thousands, millions of them, now rushing to the right, falling off the edge. And we stand there, on the other side, horrified, unable to do anything but call them back, trying to save the balance. It's too late, they're too far, they won't hear. Tonight the disk is still precariously balancing. But what about tomorrow?</p>

                    <p>Is Earth round? Some people say no. These “Flat Earthers” believe the Earth is disc or diamond-shaped and surrounded completely by an Antarctica ice wall. This concept originated with British writer Samuel Rowbotham around 1849, who argued “the bible supported the idea that the earth was flat and immoveable, and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture.” Setting aside the fact that the current canonical stories of the bible were written by humans up to 400 years after the timing of their topic, what else do these humans conjecture? Well, it varies wildly: some don’t believe in outer space, some believe in an infinite plane, and others believe atheists are trying to use science to suppress their religion. </p>

                    <p>Riding a bike in the Summer, in the middle of the afternoon or at 2AM, wherever I am, fills me with a strange feeling halfway between nostalgia and euphoria. I feel immensely free on a bike. I can move faster, go further. It expands my horizon and at the same time densifies my apprehension of the space around me. I remember one of the first times I rode a bike in Paris: I connected places I had never been aware were so close, because I was used to reaching them with the subway. I remember very vividly how I felt (and the beauty of the landscape) when, after the months of confinement, I was able to ride a bike again in the countryside. Some people dream of flying endlessly in the sky, I think I could dream of riding a bike all over Earth. </p>

                    <p>I read somewhere that people in Texas are getting “Summertime SAD.” When I think about seasonal affective disorder, I’ve never considered it to be applicable outside of winter, perhaps early spring. Basically, when it is dark and wet. Normal summers are anti-SAD with blue skies, warm, dry breezes, bright sunshine, etc., etc... It turns out that this is typical weather in places along the southern US states. By contrast, in their summers the heat skyrockets to a point where it is oppressive and quite seriously dangerous to be outside for any moderate length of time. So, whereas the northern parts of North America hunker down in the winter and spring, the southern parts seek refuge in full summer. So far, I like the north - I’m pretty happy with the Quebec summer weather even if I know Winter Is Coming.</p>

It is not easy: I feel like I'm waiting on so many things to settle. The politics in France, more dreadful than ever, the answers after our applications to apartments, knowing where will be our next home, and then, the rest, the furnishing, the building new habits, new projects. And yet, here we are, the two of us in that house that isn't ours, living through the Summer. With walks by the river, with watching the tomatoes popping up on the branches (they'll turn red soon) and the weeds growing, and the repeated gesture of unrolling that watering hose every night. For sure, that gesture, we'll forget when the Summer is over.</p>

                    <p>I used to go on hikes with my sister when she came out to work remotely during the pandemic. In the rural Midwest it was easy to find trails where you wouldn’t encounter another sole the entire day you were out there. We spotted mushrooms, identified plants, watched the colors of the leaves change as the season progressed. I saw more of the state with her than I had seen since I’d first arrived years ago. I didn’t fully appreciate it though – if we were still trekking after 5pm I would get frustrated that I would miss my chance to call my fiancée. I could kind of be a pain about it. I didn’t appreciate enough the hikes and the time we were spending together. Looking back, those are some of the fondest memories I have of living there. </p>

                    <p>Every year, my school organized a cross-country race. We would practice endurance running, doing endless laps around the small soccer field. The circuit was the same every year: through the farm court behind the municipal sports hall (they had a dachshund who would chase after you), to the right down the gravel path, straight alongside the garlic and wheat fields, then up the grass field -freshly mowed for the occasion, under the walnut tree, over the small bridge over the little stream, and straight up down my classmates' backyards to finish at the end of that old honor field. There were landmarks to keep on track: for example, I could spend hundreds of characters recalling the particular color of the piece of fabric hanging from the walnut tree.</p>

                    <p>Aphantasia is a characteristic where someone doesn’t form or use mental images as part of the thinking or imagination process: if someone asked you to picture a hummingbird, or an Alaskan landscape, could you? Some people can’t, and it is not a disease or medical condition, it is just one way brains process information. Intriguingly, there are different degrees of aphantasia, from having the equivalent of 4k HD mental images to thinking about what you are supposed to visualize, but not seeing anything. What’s more, there are even different subgroups, such as the inability to imagine objects versus landscapes. I suppose I am lucky – I can recall exactly where something was that I read on a page, but if you ask me to picture a soccer ball, I can barely generate a colored circle. Guess which one helped me more in school?</p>

                    <p>There are two soccer fields in my hometown. We referred to one as the &quot;small field&quot; and I've  always heard my dad call the other one the &quot;honor field.&quot; It is used for official competitions. I &quot;played&quot; rugby once on that honor field when my primary school teacher organized an inter-class, girls and boys, rugby competition. Aside from this notable exception, soccer and rugby were for boys so I didn't have reasons to go on the honor field. I'm convinced that it was inaccessible during a long period of time, probably when they remodeled the landscape around it. But my memory is fleeting, I can barely picture the field during the construction (I was 8 or 9), and even if I know the field looked different  after, I can no longer remember what changed.</p>

                    <p>A couple days ago a friend told me that he used to live near a school where he played sports as a kid. When he said the name, I instantly lit up – I played sports there too! In fact, that is the exact place where I learned how to play softball before moving on to play competitive nationally. I remember the different softball fields, the massive playground nearby, the snack bar that the parents had to take turns manning. My friend laughed a little when I started reminiscing – back when he was there it was just a series of fields where community-sponsored youth teams would meet, with not much else around. He’s not that much older than me, but still the places we both know are almost worlds apart. It’s crazy how much an area can change in just a little bit of time.</p>

                    <p>Cultural differences appear in many instances of our daily 
life. But when you spend enough time with someone who grew up 
in a different culture, you slowly forget about your initial 
cultural standards. With the force of habit, the outcome of the 
confrontation (or fusion) of your culture and the other's 
becomes a new norm. The next cultural clash might as well 
happen with someone who grew up in the same culture as you: in 
the same fashion, sometimes I simply can't remember what 
something is called in my mother tongue when I speak to a 
French person. I think food is certainly more resistent to 
these cultural adaptations. I can get used to eating guacamole 
more often, but I surely can't wrap my head around considering 
quiches only a breakfast meal.</p>

                    <p>One thing people don’t tell you about growing older is how difficult it is to decide what to eat – every day, three times a day. Meal prepping is okay, but am I getting enough variety of vitamins and veggies? Do I really want to eat that protein burrito every day for the next two months? Meal planning seems like a better option but gets KO ’ed when A. or I have specific cravings or stay downtown late (yes, let’s go to Mr Beef for a burger, which happens to also be the only nearby place open at this hour). That leaves delivered meal kits, which are a good idea and have a decent level of spontaneity, but are also prohibitively expensive. To sum it up: it should be healthy, cheap, easy to prepare, and not something we have eaten recently. So, do you have any ideas for dinner?</p>

                    <p>Growing plants in a garden has been on my mind for several years. I enjoy helping my sister in her farm when I visit her, and of course I hold good memories of harvesting my parents' garden -even my first jobs in fields as a teenager are synonyms with hardwork but enjoyable times: harvesting garlic, detasseling corn, etc. But I've actually never had the occasion to be really in charge of a garden: there was always someone else more responsible, more involved than me for the day-to-day care, the weeding, the watering, etc. I've never even had the equipment, the space and the time or the motivation, all of that at once. This Summer is different: we're trying to grow basil and tomatoes in M.'s garden for his return. I hope to get to eat some of it!</p>

                    <p>Once upon a time, and sometimes still these days when I am particularly inspired, I wanted to be a carpenter. The idea of making useful things, practical things out of wood was very attractive. These days, it is easy to find short videos of people showing you how to make a “simple” bookcase or a “simple” planter’s box. “Simple,” put simply, seems to be broadly interpreted. The average person does not have a table saw, a jointer, and a drill press just lying around. The prerequisites are often extensive. Luckily, I discovered Woodworking for Mere Mortals which relies less on acquiring a stockpile of tools and more on how someone can learn and do everything they need to with a limited budget and limited space. I’m getting great ideas to spruce up our future apartment!</p>

                    <p>M. says that bugs are useful, that when technology doesn't work, at least not the way we want or expect, it forces us to stop and think about our environment and tools. He also debunks a myth I was particularly attached to: Grace Hopper is often said to be the one who coined the &quot;bug&quot; expression, after having found a cockroach or a bedbug in a computer unit. In my lab in France, we had meeting rooms called after renowned scientists and Grace Hopper was one of them. I really liked the idea that someone whose name was so close to that of a bug (grasshopper) had coined the usage of the word &quot;bug&quot; in her discipline. But it's inaccurate, the expression already existed then, and she simply  made it to posterity thanks to a well calculated pun! </p>

                    <p>It’s bee season and I don’t like bugs. But I do like to bee prepared if one gets close. Sitting on the deck, cooling off from a heatwave can be a relaxing activity – as long as bees aren’t actively trying to land on you. Which ones are the most dangerous? Well, that’s the Africanized honeybee. But here in Canada where there’s only 800/20,000 species, the most common ones to worry about are yellow-jackets. They will sting you just for the heck of it. These vicious little dudes can be identified by their small, narrow-waisted two-part body with yellow/black stripes on the bottom and mostly black on the top half. What else to look out for? Paper-wasps and hornets. Honey bees are actually the chill-est of the bunch, something we can bee positive about.</p>

                    <p>This morning, the radio reminded me that today is the beginning of Summer. &quot;Hard to believe with the rains we've known lately, and yet...&quot; They said. Here in Montreal, it seems more believable: we've been going through a heatwave for a few days. It's the kind of weather that could make me desperate for an intensity control button. Nine years ago, days for days, J. and I were also caught in terrible temperatures: we had just arrived in Las Vegas after spending two days at the Grand Canyon. It was at least 45°C during the day and, while we spent the night on The Strip, the temperatures didn't drop below 38°C. I had bought a nice big water bottle at the Grand Canyon visitor center because I didn't have any. This week, this very bottle broke. </p>

                    <p>There’s an episode of The Twilight Zone where a man finds a miniature model of a city in his attic. As he fiddles with it, he realizes that what happens to the model is mimicked in the town itself, from weather changes to structures changing. He has complete control over the town. While he could have gone Bruce Almighty-esque and done whatever he pleased to further his own agenda, instead, he chooses to dig through the letter box of suggestions to improve the city and systematically fixes all the deteriorated, broken-down components, even potholes bothering some elderly residents.  It is an interesting take on the power of one individual as an agent of change and the good that can be done for the lives of many. Each in our own way, we can all make a difference.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Sonder&quot; was &quot;coined by John Koenig in his project 'The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows',&quot; ChatGPT tells me. I remembered hearing about it on Instagram last year. I had forgotten the term, so I tried to find it on Google and eventually turned to ChatGPT: I needed feedback to rephrase my request, it gave me the answer right away. 'Sonder' describes the realization that random passersby are the main character of their own lifestory, and that, just as they are insignificant extras in our life, we do not represent anything but a detail in their field of vision. Often, and for so long I can't remember when I started, when I walk in the street, I try to trick my brain into peeking at the abyss of this realization. It fills me with an enthusiastic vertigo.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes we need to set boundaries, sometimes we need to vent, and sometimes we just need to be lazy. I’ve been told that the important thing is to listen and understand what our body is telling us. However, this is not an ideal world and pressure comes from all sides, including inside. What makes it okay to give oneself a break and not be perfect 100% of the time? Honestly, I don’t know the answer to that. Maybe it is just simply that no one is perfect. What I do know is that hearing someone say, “yes, I agree, you deserve to…” is like a breath of fresh air. Wait, someone else agrees and I don’t have to fight tooth and nail for this little bit of grace? Where’s the trick, what’s the catch? Wait, you just…agree?</p>

Last night you said: &quot;I don't put an alarm, I'll wake up when I wake up.&quot; You earned it, you said, having woken up at 6 to go on a run, before going on a hike with me. I agree. I remember a time, soon after the first Covid confinement, when everybody was trying to get back to exercising or walking every day. My employer had created a team challenge: through an app, it added up each team's daily steps. Some days, the app was just unashamedly sharing with my colleagues that I'd had one of those lazy days. </p>

For the longest time I just accepted the shade people would throw at Americans for not having enough imagination to create names for our own cities. That we had to copy from older, more established civilizations. What I didn’t realize until much later is the opposite is true. When these cities were established, they were likely colonies held by a foreign power. These foreign colonists settled and used names from their homeland as the foundation for their new life abroad. However, now that the land is controlled by the USA, its easy to forget that the duplicate wasn’t just caused by “those lazy Americans.”</p>

                    <p>Many towns and streets are named after saints in France or in Canada. Growing up, I've got used to these names in France, to the point that I'm often barely aware of their religious origins. In my mind, &quot;Saint-Remi&quot; refers to a specific spot in my hometown, not to a saint or a martyr. In Montreal, however, the omnipresence of christian names sometimes feels overwhelming. There are historical reasons for that, of course, but I recently realized that the reason I'm so aware of it is because the saints here have different names than in France. For example, I had never heard the name &quot;Zotique&quot; before coming here. Unfortunately, my investigation to find out where the name comes from won't go far tonight: there's no entry for 'Zotique' on Wikipedia.</p>

                    <p>A good playlist makes all the difference when I am trying to get back into running. A song too slow, and my pace will decline, or I’ll lose the mental capacity for slogging one foot after another, mile after mile. A song too fast will burn me out and I’ll be left gasping for breath on the side of the road. But a series of good songs that keep me properly paced, energized and maintaining the right headspace? The workout won’t just be easier: it will fly by. There’s a saying that having fun helps arduous tasks feel less lengthy - you become distracted from constantly monitoring the clock, thus time seems to pass more quickly. For me it is effective for a couple hours’ workout. But those ultra-marathon runners must have incredible playlists.</p>

                    <p>The floor, in this house that isn't ours, shakes when a bus drives down the street. When I sit at M.'s desk, I can feel the deep vibrations from the floor under my chair. They travel up my legs and through my elbows. It makes me feel unstable, on edge, as if the house is about to take off and move into orbit. It makes me want to get up and move. I should just go in the middle of the room and shake it off dancing on the rythm of the music playing in my ears. 
I think this repeated agitation echoes my impatience to settle down in our own home: the provisionality of our situation makes our surrounding unstable, ready to take off or dissipate. I hold on to M.'s desk, and I wonder if he works better at night, when the bus is not running. </p>

                    <p>Sometimes I wonder if it wouldn’t be better to annotate our lives. Write down daily summaries to remind ourselves of what we have done, who we need to get back to, and what we need to do in the near future. Little daily messages to ourselves. Most people would probably say it’s easy – make a journal, put in a calendar reminder for follow-up messages or write a to-do list. None of these really solve the problem itself, which is sometimes all the moving parts are too numerous or moving too fast to keep track of, so the solution is not to add more responsibilities, more parts that require updating. However, without some sort of aid, things can fall through the cracks. Messages get left unanswered, on read. </p>

                    <p>A commitment is an agreement for the future, a pledge to do something we say we'll do. Like this duet project. Or like signing a lease. Interestingly, in Git, a commit is only the capture of the state of a project. A <code>git commit</code> is not a commitment for the future but an agreement on the past. And this agreement is not even imutable: a simple <code>git commit --amend</code> and you can change the whole log. In Git, there is still time to go back in time, no need to think twice about a commit message. Can there be regrets in Git? Sometimes, I wish life could work like that: didn't think this through long enough? Let me just go back to the previous state and make some changes! But then, we wouldn't want to risk getting caught in a real-life merge conflict...</p>
